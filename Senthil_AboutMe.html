              <p class="text-break"> Hi, my name is AnishKumar Senthil and I am currently a freshman studying at Dublin High School. My present career goal is to work in the IT industry and specifically as a Data Analyst. Later in my career, I also hope to become a businessman and eventually start and own my own business. To achieve my goals I am looking forward to major in finance, business management, and a computer science course. I wish to work as a Data Analyst since I like reading and deciphering logistics and other data types. I also wish to have my own business since both my parents always dreamed to start their own business and have always pushed me to live with a business mentality and start our very own business. Thus owning a business would fulfill my parent’s dreams of having someone in the family own business. With the IT field growing more and more as the world begins to rely on it, and with my personal dream of owning my own business, these are two specific fields that I am eager to get involved in. 
                <br>
                <br>
              Some valuable qualities and characteristics I possess are being responsible, resourceful, efficient, and open-minded. Both fields in which I aspire to work in require a person to be responsible for their duties in order to get work done. I am very proficient at this skill and always focused on finishing the task at hand to fulfill my part of the job and also help others in order to get the work done. I am also a very resourceful and efficient person. As I play various sports and am also on school sports teams, being efficient at working is a skill I developed to finish my work properly. Since practices usually end late for most sports, I have had to work with a smaller time amount and resources to still get my work done. Over time, I have learned and become better at being efficient and resourceful, which are both skills needed in the work area. In addition, I am also a very open-minded person. From also playing baseball and basketball, I have learned over time to accept some of the criticism that your coach or teammates might give. Listening to other people’s advice helped me become better at both sports since I can listen to critique from different points of view, and this provided me with another skill that would be useful in any work environment.

                <br>
                <br>
                	So far in my time in high school, I have participated in numerous activities. I have been involved in DECA (An Association of Marketing Students), a business-oriented club, Dublin High School robotics, and was also on the freshman football team. What I have learned most from these experiences so far is that keeping up with everything in life in addition to out of school activities is entirely my problem that I must time manage to complete all my tasks. Time management is key to anything, and managing your time for anything you do is key to being successful anywhere.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In conclusion, I believe I have the qualities, characteristics, and expiriences that can translate into any field and help me work cohesively there. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and I hope you explore the rest of my site. Have a great day!
