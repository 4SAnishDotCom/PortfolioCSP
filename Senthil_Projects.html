                  For this project, where we worked in MIT App Inventor, me and my partner chose to modify a game called Space Invaders from a tutorial. Space Invaders is a game where a rocket ship has multiple bullets which it uses to shoot at a saucer, at the top of the screen. We decided to split up our plan into 3 tiers or rankings of which we needed to accomplish, and due to time constraints we managed to finish 2 tiers. From the basic Space Invaders that we started off with, we added another level, different obstacles, multiple shooters, and an introduction and conculsion to give our game a story element. I worked developing another level, different obstacles, and multiple shooters. We learned as a team that block based code cannot fulfil all the needs and is restricted, so we had to adapt and change our plan accordingly. In this project, I also had to analyze data from our feedback to further change our game to make it better and had to think of further problems based on our feedback that might affect our game and change that as well. All in all, me and my partner  had a good team dynamic and displayed consistant and good communication which really helped us achieve our main goal for this project.

                  To create this project, my partner and I coded with Python in a platform called Repl.it . We decided the objective of our game was to escape jail by solving three challenges. Each challenge varied in difficulty and depending on which challenge you chose, you may get a different ending to the game. For the first challenge, the user got to pick from a choice of three riddles to solve and each riddle had a different level of difficulty. The second challenge was also another riddle. For the third and final challenge the user was given a 6 by 6 map in which they had to find a shovel to dig there way out and the user was also limited to a certain number of tries to find the shovel. After finding the shovel the user had two options of escaping in which only one option, which was the most logical option, would lead to succesfully escaping and completing the game. My role in this project was to provide specific documentation for our code and to code the first challenge of our game. Throughout this project both my partner and I were able to succesfully comincate with each other and assist each other when needed to give our best product by the deadline. The biggest and significant challenge we had to overcome was planning too much for such a short worktime as we thought to accomplish too much and such little time given to work on our project. In this project I learned the importance of planning realistically and thoroughly before starting the project. This was also the first time in which I used python to create a game and I got a chance to learn the shortcuts and take future notes for myself while using python. In conclusion, my Partner and I used great teamwork and coding skills to produce one of the top Escape Room projects in our class.
